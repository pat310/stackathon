# contemporaryArt

Contemporary Art is an app that uses the phone's gryscope act as a paint brush.

To use this app (which is not yet hosted), go to localhost on both your phone and the computer. On the phone, select the option to be the painter, and select a blank canvas on the computer. From the phone you can select different paint colors, and brush thicknesses. Move the phone like a paint brush, and you artwork will appear on the canvas.
The app also has a coloring book and pictionary mode.

This was a stackathon project for Fullstack Academy.
